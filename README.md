# Introduction

GenZoo is a repository that provides implementations of generative models in various frameworks, namely Tensorflow and Pytorch. 

This will be a project taken up by VLG-IITR for the summers of 2019, done with the collaborative efforts of various students. Although in this, we majorly focus on various types of VAEs and GANs, there are many different types of generative models, and hence many different ideas that can be added in this repo. You can read more about one of them [here](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/10/13/flow-based-deep-generative-models.html).

## How to Contribute 

- Pick up any Generative Model from the list provided below (or any other model you like).
 - [Open an issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue]) with the name as the model in order to contribute for the same. Give your name, the framework, dataset and some resources you will be following for the same.
 - We will assign that issue to you (if no one has been assigned earlier).
 - Start implementing the model you chose (by forking the repo and creating a new branch). Some further instructions are as follows:
     - Create a new folder named as your Model (**if such a folder is not already present**).
     - Create the following inside the folder:
         - `data_loader.py` - To load the required dataset.
         - `model.py` - To define the architecture of your model.
         - `train.py` - To define the training iterations of your model.
         - `main.py` - Main function of your implementation to call all other methods. Plot a graph showing the loss curves during the entire training process, preferably on tensorboard or tensorboardX.
         - `generated_images` - Folder containing sample images generated by your model.
         - `model.txt` - Text file containing link to your saved model on Google Drive (make sure to make the file publicly accessible).
         - Train your model using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Refer to instructions below for tips on using it.
    - Save your model on Google Drive. For pytorch, [refer this](https://medium.com/@ml_kid/how-to-save-our-model-to-google-drive-and-reuse-it-2c1028058cb2) and for tensorflow, [refer this](https://medium.com/@rajath95/how-to-save-and-upload-deep-learning-machine-learning-models-in-google-colab-using-google-drive-eb2901937ae).
 - [Open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) after you finish your implementation.
 - Your implementation will be added to GenZoo once we review your pull request.
